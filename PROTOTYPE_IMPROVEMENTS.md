# Tonkin Knowledge Finder - Prototype Improvements

## üöÄ High-Impact Improvements We Could Make

### 1. **Real Document Integration** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current**: Sample/fake project data  
**Improvement**: Use actual Tonkin documents (with sensitive info redacted)

**Why This Would Be Powerful:**
- Demonstrates real value with actual Tonkin projects
- Shows genuine search scenarios engineers face
- Builds immediate credibility with stakeholders
- Provides realistic testing environment

**What We'd Need:**
- 10-20 recent SF84 Project Basis Reports (anonymized)
- Permission to use project data for demo purposes
- Real project numbers, locations, team names

### 2. **Multi-Document Type Support** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current**: SF84 documents only  
**Improvement**: Add Risk Registers, PEPs, Go/No-Go documents

**Implementation:**
```python
# Add parsers for different document types
parsers = {
    'SF84': SF84Parser(),
    'RISK_REGISTER': RiskRegisterParser(),
    'PEP': PEPParser(),
    'GO_NO_GO': GoNoGoParser()
}

# Link documents by project number
def create_project_knowledge_graph(project_number):
    related_docs = find_all_project_documents(project_number)
    return ProjectKnowledgeGraph(related_docs)
```

**Demo Impact:**
- Search: "What risks were identified in bridge projects?"
- Results: Show risk registers from multiple bridge projects
- Cross-reference solutions from different document types

### 3. **Visual Document Processing** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current**: Text-only processing  
**Improvement**: Extract information from site plans, photos, drawings

**Capabilities:**
- **Site Plans**: Extract location, layout, dimensions
- **Photos**: Analyze construction progress, site conditions
- **Drawings**: Identify technical specifications, materials

**Example Enhancement:**
```python
def process_visual_documents(file_path):
    if file_path.endswith('.jpg') or file_path.endswith('.png'):
        # Use OCR to extract text from images
        text = ocr_engine.extract_text(file_path)
        
        # Use AI to describe image content
        description = vision_ai.describe_image(file_path)
        
        return {
            'extracted_text': text,
            'image_description': description,
            'file_type': 'photo'
        }
```

### 4. **Enhanced Search Intelligence** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Improvement**: Context-aware, conversational search

**Advanced Features:**
- **Follow-up Questions**: "Show me more projects like this"
- **Comparative Analysis**: "How does this compare to similar projects?"
- **Trend Analysis**: "What's changed in our approach over time?"

**Implementation:**
```python
class AdvancedSearchEngine:
    def conversational_search(self, query, context=None):
        # Understand user intent
        intent = self.analyze_intent(query)
        
        if intent == 'comparison':
            return self.compare_projects(query, context)
        elif intent == 'trend_analysis':
            return self.analyze_trends(query)
        else:
            return self.semantic_search(query)
```
