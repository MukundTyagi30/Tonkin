## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### 1. Check the Detailed Guide
```bash
open DEPLOY_NOW.md
```

cd "/Users/mukundtyagi/Desktop/tonkin protoype "
bash start_local.sh
```

### 3. Check Deployment Logs
- **Railway**: Dashboard → Your Project → View Logs
- **Netlify**: Dashboard → Site → Deploys

### 4. Common Issues

**CORS Error**:
- Add your Netlify URL to `api.py`
- Commit and push

**No Search Results**:
- Check `REACT_APP_API_URL` in Netlify
- Test backend: `curl https://your-railway-url/health`

**Build Failed**:
- Check Railway/Netlify logs
- Verify all dependencies are in place

---

## ✨ Pro Tips

1. **Deploy backend first**, get URL, then deploy frontend
2. **Test locally** before deploying: `bash start_local.sh`
3. **Save your URLs** - write them down after deployment
4. **Use GitHub integration** for auto-deploys (Netlify Option B)
5. **Check browser console** (F12) if something doesn't work
