## 📦 Quick Deploy

### Option 1: Deploy Full Stack (Recommended)

**Backend → Railway + Frontend → Netlify**

```bash
# 1. Deploy backend
# Go to: https://railway.app
# → New Project → Deploy from GitHub → Select your repo
# → Get URL: https://your-app.railway.app

# 2. Build frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# 3. Deploy frontend
# Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
# → Drag 'build' folder
# → Add env var: REACT_APP_API_URL = https://your-app.railway.app

# Done! 🎉
```

**Total time: ~10 minutes**

### Option 2: Test Locally First

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
bash start_local.sh

# Or manually:
# Terminal 1:
uvicorn api:app --reload

# Terminal 2:
cd frontend && npm start
```

Visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔌 API Endpoints

Your backend (`api.py`) provides these endpoints:

```python
GET  /                 # Health check
GET  /health           # Detailed health status
GET  /docs             # Interactive API documentation
POST /api/search       # Search projects
POST /api/feedback     # Submit user feedback
POST /api/lessons      # Add lessons learned
GET  /api/stats        # System statistics
GET  /api/categories   # Available categories
GET  /api/regions      # Available regions
```

**Try it**: Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` after starting the backend

---

## 🎨 Two Deployment Modes

### Mode 1: Demo Mode (No Backend Required)

```javascript
// frontend/src/config.js
export const USE_SAMPLE_DATA = true;
```

**Perfect for:**
- Quick demos
- UI testing
- Offline presentations
- Frontend-only deployment

**Deploy**: Just deploy frontend to Netlify/Vercel

### Mode 2: Production Mode (Full Stack)

```javascript
// frontend/src/config.js
export const USE_SAMPLE_DATA = false;
export const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;
```

**Perfect for:**
- Real user searches
- Production deployment
- Database integration
- Full functionality

**Deploy**: Backend to Railway + Frontend to Netlify

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start everything
bash start_local.sh

# Test backend
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test search
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"stormwater","top_k":5}'

# Test frontend
# Open browser: http://localhost:3000
# Try searching for "bridge" or "stormwater"
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# After deployment, test:
curl https://your-backend.railway.app/health
curl https://your-backend.railway.app/docs

# Open frontend:
# https://your-frontend.netlify.app
# Try a search, filters, feedback, lessons
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Frontend (Netlify/Vercel)**
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
```

**Backend (Railway/Render)**
```env
# No special vars needed for basic setup
# PORT is auto-set by platform
```

### CORS Configuration

Update `api.py` with your frontend URL:
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:3000",              # Local dev
        "https://your-app.netlify.app",       # Production
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

| **Backend** | Railway | ⚠️ Limited | $5/mo | 5 mins |

### Alternatives

**Frontend:**
- Vercel (excellent for React)
- GitHub Pages (static only)
- AWS S3 + CloudFront (scalable)
- Azure Static Web Apps

**Backend:**
- Render.com (free tier available)
- Heroku (no longer free)
- AWS EC2/Elastic Beanstalk
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure App Service

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps (Detailed)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code

```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add full-stack deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend

**Railway (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up / Login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your repository
6. Railway auto-detects Python and uses:
   - `requirements.txt` for dependencies
   - `Procfile` or `railway.json` for start command
7. Wait ~3 minutes for deployment
8. Copy your URL: `https://your-project.railway.app`

**Test**:
```bash
curl https://your-project.railway.app/health
```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend

**Netlify (Recommended)**

Method A - Drag & Drop:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
# Drag 'build' folder to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
```

Method B - GitHub Integration:
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Choose GitHub → Select your repo
4. Build settings:
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/build`
5. Deploy

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

In Netlify:
1. Go to: Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add variable:
   - Key: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://your-project.railway.app`
3. Redeploy site

### Step 5: Update CORS

Edit `api.py`:
```python
allow_origins=[
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "https://your-actual-site.netlify.app",  # Add this!
],
```

Commit and push → Railway auto-redeploys

### Step 6: Test End-to-End

1. Open your Netlify URL
2. Try searching for "stormwater" or "bridge"
3. Check filters work
4. Submit feedback
5. Add a lesson learned
6. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Check for errors

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: CORS Error

```
Access to fetch at 'https://backend.railway.app/api/search' 
from origin 'https://frontend.netlify.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution**:
1. Edit `api.py` → Add your Netlify URL to `allow_origins`
2. Commit and push
3. Wait for Railway to redeploy (~2 mins)

### Problem: Search Returns Empty Results

**Check**:
1. Is backend running? `curl https://your-backend.railway.app/health`
2. Is `REACT_APP_API_URL` set correctly in Netlify?
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Is the database initialized with data?

### Problem: Railway Deploy Fails

**Solutions**:
1. Check Railway logs in dashboard
2. Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
3. Test locally: `pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn api:app`
4. Check Python version in `runtime.txt` (should be 3.11)

### Problem: Frontend Build Fails

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Logs

**Railway (Backend)**:
- Dashboard → Your project → View logs
- Real-time logging of requests and errors

**Netlify (Frontend)**:
- Dashboard → Site → Deploys
- Build logs and function logs

### Analytics

Add to `frontend/public/index.html`:
```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_ID"></script>

<!-- Or privacy-friendly Plausible -->
<script defer data-domain="yourdomain.com" src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"></script>
```

### Costs

**Free Tier Usage**:
- Netlify: 100GB bandwidth/month, unlimited sites
- Railway: $5 credit/month (usually enough for testing)

**Scaling**:
- Add custom domain (free on both platforms)
- Upgrade Railway plan for production ($5-20/month)
- Add CDN for global performance
