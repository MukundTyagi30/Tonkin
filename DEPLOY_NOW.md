# 🚀 Deploy Your App NOW - Step-by-Step Guide

## ✅ What's Been Done

✅ Backend API created (`api.py`)  
✅ Frontend built and ready (`frontend/build/`)  
✅ All code committed to GitHub  
✅ **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/MukundTyagi30/Tonkin.git  

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Follow These!)

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Railway**
   - Open: https://railway.app
   - Click "Login" → Sign in with GitHub

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose: `MukundTyagi30/Tonkin`

3. **Configure Deployment**
   - Railway will auto-detect Python
   - It will use:
     - `requirements.txt` for dependencies
     - `Procfile` or `railway.json` for start command
   - No configuration needed!

4. **Wait for Deploy** (~3 minutes)
   - Watch the build logs
   - Look for: "✅ Build successful"

5. **Get Your Backend URL**
   - Click on your deployment
   - Find "Domains" section
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Copy the URL: `https://tonkin-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

6. **Test Backend**
   ```bash
   # Replace with YOUR Railway URL
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
   ```
   
   Should return: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

**✅ Backend is LIVE!**

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Netlify (3 minutes)

#### Option A: Drag & Drop (Easiest)

1. **Go to Netlify Drop**
   - Open: https://app.netlify.com/drop
   - (Create account if needed - free)

2. **Upload Build Folder**
   - From your computer, drag this folder:
     `/Users/mukundtyagi/Desktop/tonkin protoype /frontend/build`
   - Drop it onto the Netlify page
   - Wait ~30 seconds

3. **Get Your Frontend URL**
   - Netlify gives you a URL like: `https://random-name-12345.netlify.app`
   - Click on it to view your app

4. **Configure Environment Variable**
   - In Netlify, go to: Site settings → Environment variables
   - Click "Add a variable"
   - Key: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app` (from Step 1)
   - Click "Save"

5. **Redeploy**
   - Go to: Deploys → Trigger deploy → Deploy site
   - Wait ~1 minute

**✅ Frontend is LIVE!**

#### Option B: GitHub Integration (Recommended for updates)

1. **Go to Netlify**
   - Open: https://app.netlify.com
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"

2. **Connect GitHub**
   - Choose "GitHub"
   - Select repository: `MukundTyagi30/Tonkin`
   - Click "Authorize"

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/build`
   - Click "Deploy site"

4. **Add Environment Variable**
   - Go to: Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add: `REACT_APP_API_URL` = `https://your-railway-url.railway.app`

5. **Redeploy**
   - Deploys → Trigger deploy

**Now every git push will auto-deploy!** 🎉

---

### Step 3: Update CORS in Backend (IMPORTANT!)

Your frontend needs permission to call your backend.

1. **Get Your Netlify URL**
   - Copy it (e.g., `https://tonkin-finder.netlify.app`)

2. **Update api.py locally**
   - Open: `api.py`
   - Find line ~23 (CORS configuration)
   - Update to:
   ```python
   allow_origins=[
       "http://localhost:3000",
       "https://tonkin-finder.netlify.app",  # Add YOUR Netlify URL here
   ],
   ```

3. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/mukundtyagi/Desktop/tonkin protoype "
   git add api.py
   git commit -m "Add production CORS origin"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Railway Auto-Redeploys**
   - Watch Railway dashboard
   - Wait ~2 minutes for redeploy
   - Check logs for "✅ Build successful"

---

### Step 4: Test Your Live App! 🎉

1. **Open Your Netlify URL**
   - `https://your-app.netlify.app`

2. **Try a Search**
   - Type: "stormwater management"
   - Click "SEARCH PROJECTS"
   - Results should load from your Railway backend!

3. **Test Features**
   - ✅ Search works
   - ✅ Filters work
   - ✅ Trust scores display
   - ✅ Feedback buttons work
   - ✅ Lesson input works

4. **Check Browser Console** (F12)
   - No CORS errors
   - No red errors
   - Should see API calls to Railway

**If you see results → YOU'RE LIVE!** 🎉🎉🎉

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "CORS policy blocked" error

**Symptoms**: Frontend loads but search returns errors

**Fix**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check the error message
3. Make sure you added your Netlify URL to `api.py`
4. Push the change to GitHub
5. Wait for Railway to redeploy

### Issue: Search returns no results

**Check**:
1. Is backend healthy? `curl https://your-railway-url/health`
2. Is `REACT_APP_API_URL` set in Netlify?
3. Did you click "Redeploy" after adding the env var?

### Issue: Railway deploy failed

**Fix**:
1. Check Railway build logs
2. Look for the error
3. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies (check `requirements.txt`)
   - Wrong Python version (check `runtime.txt`)
4. If needed, update and push again

### Issue: Netlify build failed

**Fix**:
1. Check Netlify deploy logs
2. Make sure build settings are:
   - Base: `frontend`
   - Build: `npm run build`
   - Publish: `frontend/build`
